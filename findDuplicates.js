Problem Statement:

You are given an array of integers. Write a function findDuplicates to return an array containing all the
elements that appear more than once in the array. Each element in the result should appear only once, even
if it appears multiple times in the original array.

Instructions:

Implement the findDuplicates function to return an array containing all elements that appear more than once in the input array.
The order of elements in the result does not matter.
Each element in the result should appear only once, even if it appears multiple times in the original array.

*/

const arr1 = [4, 3, 2, 7, 8, 2, 3, 1];
console.log(findDuplicates(arr1)); // Output: [2, 3]

const arr2 = [1, 1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 4, 4, 5];
console.log(findDuplicates(arr2)); // Output: [1, 2, 3, 4]


/**
 * @param {number[]} nums - Array of integers
 * @return {number[]} Array containing elements that appear more than once
 */
function findDuplicates(nums) {
    // Your code here
}
